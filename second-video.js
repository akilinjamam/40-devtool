// how to find out the event listener from devtool?
// copy the id name from elements and go to vs code and press cntrl f and pest the id. this case is for finding from one file. but to find out from more than one file press cntrl + shift + f;

// discussion about accessibility

// if you want you can copy style from the element of devtool by clicking-right in any specific element-tag.

// by pressing cntrl f in the devtool, you can search anything typing name, if that is found, you can see how many elements exists in your source file as well as code.
